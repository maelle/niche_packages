There are as of this writing 13,745 R packages on CRAN <https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/> 
and 1,649 packages on Bioconductor <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software>.
A small handful of these R packages get most of the downloads, usage, and attention, while most
of the other packages are used by few people. 

The widely used packages get lots of usage, surfacing bugs, improving the software.

- likely that maintainers of niche packages have little time to work on them

- maintainer should be a domain expert, so at least you have one power user
